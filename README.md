# How to Create a Budget and Invest in the Stock Market

Budgeting is the process of planning how to use your income to cover expenses, save for the future, and invest for long-term growth. By building a budget, you can take control of your money and make sure a portion of it is invested in the stock market, where it has the potential to grow over time.

> **WARNING:** Investing always carries risk. You may lose money as well as make money. Only invest what you can afford to set aside for long-term growth.

## Steps

### 1. Calculate Your Total Monthly Income
Write down all sources of income after taxes. Include salary, freelance work, or side income.

### 2. List All Fixed Expenses
Record costs that stay the same each month, such as rent, loan payments, and subscriptions.

### 3. List Variable Expenses
Estimate categories like groceries, gas, entertainment, and dining out.

### 4. Separate Needs from Wants
Label each expense as either a "need" (essential) or a "want" (non-essential).

### 5. Choose a Budgeting Method
A simple beginner method is the 50/30/20 rule:
- **50% of income** → needs
- **30%** → wants
- **20%** → savings/investing

### 6. Decide on Your Investment Percentage
From your savings/investing category, set aside at least 10–15% of your total income for stock market investments. Adjust higher if possible.

### 7. Open a Brokerage Account
Choose a reputable online broker, create an account, and link your bank.

### 8. Set Up Automatic Transfers
Schedule a transfer so that your chosen investment percentage moves directly from your bank into your brokerage account each month.

### 9. Select Beginner-Friendly Investments
For simplicity, many beginners start with index funds or ETFs that track the overall stock market.

### 10. Place Your First Investment
Use your brokerage account to buy shares of the ETF, index fund, or stock of your choice. Start small, and grow consistently.

### 11. Track Your Spending and Adjust
Each month, compare actual expenses with your budget. Adjust categories if you're overspending.

### 12. Review and Rebalance Regularly
Every 6–12 months, review your budget and investments. Reallocate if needed to stay on track with your goals.
